The game should be played on a board with numbered cells, typically with 100 cells.
The board should have a predefined set of snakes and ladders, connecting certain cells.
The game should support multiple players, each represented by a unique game piece.
Players should take turns rolling a dice to determine the number of cells to move forward.
If a player lands on a cell with the head of a snake, they should slide down to the cell with the tail of the snake.
If a player lands on a cell with the base of a ladder, they should climb up to the cell at the top of the ladder.
The game should continue until one of the players reaches the final cell on the board.
The game should handle multiple game sessions concurrently, allowing different groups of players to play independently.
